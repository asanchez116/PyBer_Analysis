# PyBer Analysis
## Overview 

Following a previous analysis on the fictional PyBer ridesharing company, an additional request was made to provide a summary of ride sharing data by city type which includes Urban, Suburban and Rural city types. The goal was to provide three deliverables: 

1. A data table summarizing ride sharing data broken out by city type 
2. A multiline graph showing total fares by city type
3. A brief written report of the analysis 


## Results 
* Urban cities had the most total rides as well as the most drivers and overall highest total fares 
* However, average fares per ride and average fares per driver were higest among rural cities which had the least number of drivers.

## Summary

Three recommendations to address disparities among city types include: 
1. Balancing the number of drivers to fit demand. There are more drivers than rides in rural cities. redirecting those drivers to meeting demand in suburban and rural cities can balance disparities. Redirect urban drivers prioritizing  rural cities 
2. Redirect urban drivers to suburban cities 
3. Adjust fares to reflect demand and availability
4. Accomidate for fluctations in demand. Rural cities show little variation between January and April 2019. The graph shows spikes in total fares for all three city types at the end of February. Suburban cities show a sharp upward trend in January then trend down with spikes in total fares at the end of Febuary and end of April. Urban cities show an upward trend similar to suburban cities but more steady and fluctuate most between middle of Febuary and April.
